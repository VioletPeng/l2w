he has wrought some change and left some peace in his parting . </s> death is no insult ; it is an opportunity to see ourself as we nakedly are . </s> it is a gift as much as life and as we respect it and allow it to occur in proper time , so do we respect our existence . </s> battling death is battling life . </s> to fight overly against it is to refuse others the dignity of seeing us leave as if it were no grand affair . </s>	to die simply with open eyes and allow anyone to witness is an act of the highest compassion . </s> and for my part , i long to be more compassionate and more suffused with the good . </s> i fail each day , but crave again for the profound truth . </s> i long to understand reality . </s> it may be no small measure . </s>
i see , perhaps by mistake , that desire for truth and desire for compassion are different . </s> it is a puzzle and , to me , a serious one . </s> i asked a wise teacher once how i could yearn so for truth and fall so short on compassion . </s> her answer ? </s> you may not understand your own compassion . </s>	i have begun avoiding others to an almost pathological degree . </s> if i examine myself from outside , i mistake myself for a misanthrope , but it is not the case . </s> i love people in all their infinite glory . </s> they are marvelous ; they are individual . </s> but that quantity is so secreted these days . </s>

why ? </s> because the solution to most problems is aggression and self-interest . </s> no one considers answering difficulties with compassion . </s> generosity is minimal , patience is disregarded . </s> discipline equals hard work . </s>	once , it meant concern for others . </s> exertion means a full day , perhaps twelve hours of toil . </s> but to the great minds , exertion has no end . </s> death itself does not confine it , for such minds seek a new life to do good . </s> envision this , or better , try it . </s>

yet this term is wrong against its root , for to ignore means to know , but pay no attention . </s> i like this definition named upon its base better , though it fails the lexicon . </s> it carries a dense measure of what i mean when i say that we should pray to each falling drop of rain . </s> let our mind dissolve into such vast place that we seek no self . </s> such vision is great indeed . </s>	beyond me , for i am caught in the illusion . </s> the goat situation , this boulder i rolled down a hill , now threatens to roll over me from behind , as if by magic . </s> i wanted something ; now i fear it . </s> the fear is a layer , a means of turning the ignorance into something which will continue to distract me and thus prove i am real when i am not . </s> if i knew truth , i would have no fear . </s>

roger that . </s> send the exec an e-mail telling him to bill it as freedom of speech , a principle that ikea strongly supports . </s> cause and effect http//goat : zero i fancy that i dwell in an ancient rhythm , both barbarous and sophisticated , gross in action , yet subtle in meaning , every stab at deeds a well-planned affair with a haphazard consequence . </s> the execution is the joy ; the result mere afterthought . </s> life is process , not outcome . </s>	no ultimate point exists for the activity of goat . </s> let us not write the message beforehand , let us find the meaning in the effect . </s> and that is not yet fully arisen . </s> but to speak of it in more general terms , cause and effect is not the simple affair we believe . </s> it is a web of possibility , with much cause leading to much resultant state . </s>
many initial conditions flow to an infinite result , for what can truly be said of experience ? </s> it is never-ending . </s> all things are beyond word ; nothing can be proved . </s> the key to better understanding is resting the mind on the problem . </s> all solution lies past concept . </s>	without concern , for all speculation is naught , look behind thought ; there the answer lies . </s> mostly our assumptions , our initial impressions , are wrong . </s> this is the message . </s> things are not as they seem , nor are they otherwise . </s> that which can be pinned down , nailed , understood , comprehended , accurately described or explained is of no import whatsoever . </s>
this is not to say that the truth can not be approached directly . </s> in fact , that is the only way . </s> all explanation interferes . </s> words confuse , concept betrays . </s> the real is immediate experience . </s>	profound reality is no oblique matter . </s> it is there and manifest , fully revealed , ever awaiting our gaze . </s> it is we who obstruct it . </s> and why ? </s> we are afraid , why else ? </s>
fear is a burning . </s> everything is burning , always , being consumed . </s> the furious fire of impermanence , perpetual change ravages our senses . </s> our eyes are on fire . </s> all we hear is crackling flame . </s>	we smell only the heat and smoke , taste only burning ash . </s> we feel naught but dissolution , the scorching caress of time . </s> impermanence rules all . </s> we deny it : fear . </s> this is not a cruel , despairing message . </s>
it is the way things are . </s> why fight it ? </s> all that is born must die , all that is created will be destroyed . </s> does this depress ? </s> if so , you are not free . </s>	do you find this false ? </s> if so , you concoct reality . </s> do you find this frightening ? </s> if so , you have generated a small vision . </s> everything burns always . </s>
the universe blazes , how can we arrest it ? </s> let it burn , feel it . </s> fall in love with this ; acknowledge the heartache . </s> impermanence is so beautiful . </s> currently , we fascinate at the myriad of perception . </s>	we squeeze it into hardness it does not innately possess . </s> but what perceives ? </s> as deep as mind can go into oneself , go deeper still . </s> move past all desire to name . </s> the absolute nature abides in the breeze on your skin . </s>
neither deny nor affirm , but let the play of appearance unfold , the dance of light on a lake . </s> when never has a single thing occurred , how can sorrow possibly arise and joy for that matter as well . </s> within direct experience , such things occur by not being named , and they emanate full-blown like an ocean storm , not the spring drizzles we perceive . </s> as you look direct into mind , you will draw yourself into the vast and broken heart underlying all . </s> witnessing an act of mercy , offer its beauty to your naked awareness . </s>	when mind claims a mind , becomes the small you , pay the barest attention . </s> let it rule you not . </s> before i am accused of wandering in this essay , let me bind it . </s> the underlying theme is non-concept , the absolute nature . </s> cause and effect , our beliefs , anything we name all is concept . </s>
with concept , we have shaped the world . </s> opinions , beliefs , logic , words , unvoiced , hidden axioms about the nature of being , all are wrong . </s> all these lead us astray and they can be subtle indeed . </s> easy to miss , even with rigorous scrutiny . </s> to make it simple : all concept is wrong . </s>	to be more precise : no concept is right . </s> do you see the difference ? </s> to step back , we can examine from a rougher perspective . </s> we must use concept to arrive at non-concept . </s> and first , we must understand what we mean by concept . </s>
allow us to agree that simple assertions and blithe reasoning can only miss the point . </s> such a statement must be felt to be understood , experienced to be believed . </s> words do not cook rice , it is true , but in their absence , the harvest will never begin . </s> for that matter , fire does not cook rice , nor water , nor a pot , nor a human , but only in their combination do we eat . </s> vain words , it is said , but necessary nonetheless . </s>	what symbol , words : they are a futile necessity . </s> each comes to naught ; their very abundance makes mockery of true and good sense . </s> still , without them , there would be none of what we see . </s> no houses or cars or clothes , exist without words . </s> language , which goes nowhere and does nothing , has created the world of man . </s>
a word is not a tree ; it does not exist . </s> yet look at its power . </s> with a single command kill a thousand lives may end . </s> words : history lives in ink , not actions . </s> it is a telling , not a doing . </s>	what happens matter little , eloquent witness is the principal event . </s> language is a beast , so prevalent , so pervasive , that it can not be spoken of clean . </s> one must use it upon itself , a blunt irony . </s> but for accurate and objective analysis , one must be outside the object of scrutiny . </s> the eye can not see itself . </s>
language has consequences we can never know . </s> no profound and great understanding of it is possible , because it can never be perceived from beyond its own bound . </s> where is the connection of these ideas ? </s> to return to my point of origin , cause and effect are not real ; they are merely words , concepts . </s> yet , they are how we see our whole existence . </s>	must i say it again : we base our lives upon the unreal . </s> this may seem a simple semantic argument , that the idea is not the actuality . </s> it is an obvious truth . </s> why does it matter ? </s> indeed , most would consider it idle speculative philosophy , without bearing on the human condition . </s>
it matters a great deal . </s> the concern is not the deceptive quality of language , but the actuality hidden behind . </s> language , and the intangible field of concept upon which it floats , obscures the real . </s> we are , all of us , cut off from the true nature . </s> fins & spinners ( recked ? </s>	broke legs ) they were at a party at some rich jerks mansion , and he noticed one of the crowd watching . </s> where were you born , scar ? </s> you remember that ? </s> yeah , aint it weird ? </s> i cant remember hardly nothing what happened after i was four or five . </s>

i dont hate nobody . </s> what makes you think that ? </s> you dont care about lawyers . </s> scar stared at her . </s> fins . </s>	you know . </s> damn , cookie doll , thats a job , not a person . </s> trouble from it is , these goddamn fins whats following me are more their job than they are the person . </s> there aint enough person left underneath to give a shit about . </s> you cant even find it ; theyre better off dead . </s>

entropy replied . </s> i think youre asking me to define myself . </s> but no final definition may be arrived at . </s> everything is approximate . </s> all is fluid . </s>	this is the logic of battle , and what else is existence but battle ? </s> i am entropy and i blame no one . </s> my skin is 36 years old . </s> botnet : i can not name the hour or even month of its birth . </s> when did my information frankenstein come alive ? </s>
what defines it ? </s> ( what defines the skin for that matter ? ) </s> the botnet is 400 million reprogrammable recursively linked software entities planted on personal and business computers throughout the internet . </s> other botnets exist , but mine is the largest by a magnitude of 100 times . </s> it is also far more adaptable , many generations ahead of all others . </s>	the technology is divergent , too . </s> no others will design a botnet similar to mine in functionality . </s> i fear boring you , but i have pride in this achievement . </s> and you asked . </s> the botnet is programmed using an unknown type of math called simplysis . </s>
i invented it . </s> each bot is nearly , but not exactly , identical with the near bots in its sector . </s> they are programmed in a series of shaped arrays , with core functions towards the center , and peripheral , thus more active and at-risk , functions to the outside . </s> for my interface , i have sets of shapes and colors . </s> different combinations of these perform different tasks . </s>	it sounds simplistic , but it is massively intuitive and generates tremendous processing velocity so that a human mind , or at least mine , can direct the bots activities without getting lost in the details . </s> there are deeper levels , of course , but this is the overall picture . </s> your other questions : you have hit upon my answer , a near miss , that is . </s> the worst curse of this age is the torture of the guiltless . </s> at some level , i defend the innocent . </s>
to refine that , i defend innocence , as a principle . </s> i see scar in that way , and you , as well . </s> yours is a more , perhaps awakened , innocence , but timid , almost cowardly . </s> his is more naked , uncompromised , but rougher . </s> you yearn and scar takes . </s>	he doesnt take because he wants , though . </s> he takes because hes a perfect american . </s> the best about this age ? </s> all is now possible . </s> as nietzsche said , nothing is true , everything is permitted . </s>
i would modify that for our scienza millennia . </s> nothing is provable , everything is possible . </s> very quantum-relativistic , dont you think ? </s> this limitlessness to mans potential is finally recognized , but , due to the complacency of gross entertainments and the infinite diversions , such potential is not pursued ( your dark ages theory ) . </s> no one cares what they could be ; they only care how they pass the time . </s>	but all is not lost . </s> millions must exist to create a single individual . </s> genetics is not the survival of the fittest , but the emergence of the superior . </s> i am part of that , and here to cultivate it . </s> nothing will prevent me . </s>
but , what am i , you asked . </s> my answer , of course , is what are we ? </s> and i mean that we as you , and scar and the players of this drama , and myself . </s> as you say , all is connected . </s> no one exists in isolation , so i am who i am by virtue of the interplay with my phenomena . </s>	we also could mean the skin and the botnet . </s> this phrase , the skin , it offers a tremble of revulsion . </s> well , this desire i mentioned , to defend innocence , is part of the reason the overall entropy keeps the skin alive . </s> it isnt such a horror show as it sounds , entropy is very much in the physical body . </s> attack him and see . </s>
the botnet will not let me die . </s> i have taken hundreds of hours of psychological testing and am always diagnosed insane . </s> the particulars differ , but the phrase god complex has a high frequency . </s> ah , well , we are who we are . </s> why fight it ? </s>	i exist to create the world anew . </s> i will try to give birth to a better one , but promise nothing . </s> perhaps the world ends in fire at my hands . </s> i am insane . </s> i am driven to do this , why i can not explain . </s>
i will try . </s> there are two answers . </s> one , the current track of the realm is towards complacency . </s> people are addicted to softness , comfort , convenience . </s> such is the smallness of their lives . </s>	i am with you , though , i agree , man is far more than he now allows . </s> this civilization has gone the wrong direction . </s> instead of creating the strong , the great , the profound individual , one who braves the harshness of reality with his own sense of himself , we have created a world of groupthink , based on laziness , cowardice , and virtual impotence to see another way is possible . </s> this society destroys all vision ; thus it must be destroyed . </s> second , and related , i see a greater human , but the price is chaos . </s>
entropy will hammer this civilization . </s> will it crumble ? </s> i can not say , but i will shake this tree until the fruit falls . </s> i will find superior man . </s> i am not this profound being ; my lineage has no successor . </s>	it must end with me . </s> entropy is different , too powerful to rightly exist , too lost to human values , too alone . </s> i have not reproduced because i am a messenger , not a father . </s> who would that be ? </s> perhaps even scar , he could easily be recast as a mad prophet ; those cults are appearing already . </s>
tell me about you . </s> http//goat : zero i was a goofy kid , and all i ever wanted was to hang a star on the moon . </s> but that isnt possible , so i grew up . </s> for a time i was a nihilist , i worshiped the altar of nothingness . </s> it was a vulgar achievement in its own way . </s>	extremes always deserve some little honor , even if that is only our attention for a moment . </s> then i remembered , its possible after all . </s> just make things up . </s> we each create our own world anyway . </s> one might as well control the strangeness of that process . </s>

how does one guide genius to peace ? </s> that quantity arises only from the mind itself . </s> if one lays bare the naked essence of mind , one sees that something and nothing both abide . </s> mind can not disappear for we would disappear , as well . </s> but find it , i challenge you . </s>	no rigorous scrutiny yields a thing identifiable as mind direct . </s> the traces are everywhere , but is thought mind ? </s> no , we sense , they are what mind perceives . </s> are they then different from mind ? </s> we reflect and realize they are not different either . </s>

some died terrified , though , and it wasnt fear of dying . </s> it was fear of the next thing , like they had lived awful and would live again and worse . </s> like they saw their next place and it was horrible . </s> he could never get enough of watching people die . </s> entropy didnt care if lives ended , but he seemed to find it distasteful to associate himself too freely with murder . </s>	with him , death was an often necessary by-product , but by no means the focus . </s> the captain had told him that military operations based on death marked one as amateur or madman . </s> squarehead was no amateur . </s> eight hours after leaving the morgue , squarehead was on a chartered flight to the third world . </s> the first leg was africa . </s>
the plan , at this point , was to sow chaos , then manipulate the loose openings as they occurred . </s> squarehead wasnt privy to all the details or even to the overall strategy , but he knew his commanders m.o . </s> entropy attacked at the root . </s> he waited and built up until the massive strike was ready , then it was all-out . </s> squarehead cased out business opportunities . </s>	he set up billions of dollars in deals with many different parties , then hooked the deal . </s> the papers were signed , five percent money in escrow , everything in place , waiting . </s> he did the deals , met the lawyers and faxed the papers to the captain . </s> entropy set it up electronically so that the contracts would cascade with immense public visibility . </s> when he threw the switch , everyone in the financial arena would see it . </s>
then they would do whatever they did , probably panic . </s> entropy sent him a text : phase 1 set , holding . </s> yellow widow scar looked at a billboard , which was weird . </s> he never looked at those damn things , but one of them stupid spinners that was following him pointed and he looked . </s> entropi in big white letters on a black back . </s>	he remembered that woman by that coffin . </s> he grabbed a dude and asked what it meant , but the dude didnt know so he asked another dude and he did . </s> what a piece of juice that one would be . </s> he meant that woman what that billboard made him think of . </s> them letters just stood up in the sky and talked to ole scar . </s>

they both did the same with their own real names , then used similar techniques to blur each others facial recognition . </s> living below the sensors , they each became a code word , a byline . </s> it was horrible , in a sense , the loneliness , but they had been too far along that path to turn back when their delta force careers ended . </s> they had to keep going . </s> squarehead had a tough story . </s>	delta force recruited him from the rangers because of controlled sociopathic tendencies , then let him go for the same reason years later . </s> controlled was a bit of an exaggeration , but those character traits were invaluable in combat . </s> a normal person , meaning someone with emotion , would almost always hesitate before firing or fire wildly . </s> less than one man in eight actually aimed and fired at enemy combatants during a firefight . </s> there were those who managed to overcome the human compunction and kill repeatedly . </s>
it changed them . </s> but with squarehead , there was nothing to overcome . </s> his father had done that job for them . </s> squarehead had been sexually abused and physically tortured by the man . </s> if they saw , squarehead told people the fingerprint sized scars on his back were from radiation therapy for childhood leukemia . </s>	they were actually cigarette burns . </s> they covered his body and especially his back . </s> it happened during the molestation , which explained the number on his back . </s> at thirteen , squarehead murdered his father and left home forever . </s> the death was grisly . </s>
he burned him to death in a pile of lit cigarettes after ramming a giant dildo in his ass . </s> too bad , squarehead might have been a decent human being , but his childhood screwed him up beyond repair . </s> he was cold and his lies seemed so real . </s> he could invent a mask out of the air , go into any terrain and be one of the enemy . </s> it made him the perfect mole . </s>	he was the best corporate infiltrator in the world . </s> squarehead had a foothold in four of the five major corporations that were of greatest interest in the scar following . </s> he had made the career of the now vp of overall marketing for ikea by turning the scar chaos into gold . </s> suddenly elevated to a new level of visibility , the vp was a green private thrust into a heated engagement . </s> he needed squares help and looked to him for advice on every move . </s>
square had a back office in google , where he had no real job , but controlled several employees by pretending to be an executive on new secret mystoogle projects . </s> he made up the phrase and told people not to talk about their part in the operations . </s> one of his rules was that he must penetrate each target in an operation through different means . </s> it was more than whimsy or professional pride . </s> it was also , in entropys phrasing , a matter of leveraging the pieces to a concerted whole . </s>	squarehead was an adept . </s> for ibm , he became a media quasher , someone who was ready to turn the intense spotlight surrounding scar into something less volatile that they might work with . </s> for microsoft , he offered a doorway to new technology , the possibility of expanding their markets . </s> entropy helped with that , of course . </s> with amazon he waited because he needed to crack them in the right way . </s>
he had a consultancy position in every corporation , in some manner . </s> based on widely divergent logics , they all followed squares advisory policy of funding scar to the maximum possible extent . </s> for ibm , it was an attempt to wrest control . </s> for google , it was a way to be cool . </s> amazon wanted the story and entertainment rights . </s>	microsoft went along because they wanted to be in the game and ikea saw scar as a spokesperson . </s> he went to japan to meet with some of entropys business partners there . </s> the eight men were filthy with lucre , technology titans . </s> they were ambitious and willing to take risks , which is exactly what the captain wanted . </s> they had multiple billions and they wanted to enter the world power arena . </s>
squarehead engineered a deal for them to lose big 250 million in time decay reclamation stock options . </s> they made no sense , which is why they were so attractive to investors . </s> the best was a put option on a japanese mutual fund that specialized in american tech stocks , notably google , ms and amazon . </s> the window of opportunity was only two weeks and the price for cash-in value was double . </s> a mutual fund doubling in two weeks had never happened . </s>	and it didnt this time . </s> the options expired and the business men lost their initial investment of 250 million . </s> they did it again , burning another 250 million . </s> it was done quite publicly , so everyone knew about the deals , especially investors in giima . </s> the pump was primed . </s>
the consortium created and bought new options over a period of several weeks . </s> these were sell options for google and amazon stock . </s> to mature detrimentally , google would have to drop to $ 250 share price and amazon to $ 31 , half the current values . </s> it was absurd . </s> squarehead talked to the right people at amazon , already invested in the first round , who thought they could ride the wave without threatening the company . </s>	if the options expired unused , as of course they would , they made several hundred million between four men . </s> if they matured , the men were ruined . </s> they committed a large chunk of the company , too . </s> he put out the word at google , and spread the risk over all those paper millionaires . </s> it was treated as a joke , but a fun one and most people bought in to some extent , some up to twenty or thirty thousand dollars in options sold . </s>
the first two rounds made many people a heady amount of profit . </s> finally , a stock committee went along , incrementally committing the company to 1.5 billion in option sales , when the first 500 million expired unmatured . </s> because the companies actually issued and sold the options , it seemed risk-free . </s> the third round of options was set to expire at 9am and had to be exercised at the nyse , even though google and amazon were both nasdaq . </s> it was a sucker bet . </s>	plenty of people took it , selling the options short , knowing they would never have to buy the stock . </s> the ticket was five billion invested by the japanese . </s> on the flight home , entropy sent him a text : phase 2 set , holding . </s> on scar http : //goat : zero for all his faults , scar is an honest man . </s> entropy is not . </s>
entropy is many layers of deception . </s> scar is a cloud of madness with a heart that yet beats . </s> the dark internet messiah might say that scar offers us no teaching . </s> but who is so pure that they will never die ? </s> even christ , that supposed emanation of the kingdom of heaven on earth , lost his life , and it was taken grim . </s>	my own inspiration , the buddha , died in peace , everything revealed from beginning to end . </s> when the victor let go his form , his faithful attendant asked him to teach whatever he had not yet revealed . </s> my hand has always been open , ananda . </s> i have held nothing back . </s> you must work out your own salvation with great diligence . </s>
i can only show the way . </s> but back to the man of today . </s> scar has never told a lie , or so i believe . </s> and i mean , here , i lie of intent . </s> certainly , he cooks whoppers , making up causality of events for which his absent memory gives no help . </s>	in weighty matters , issues of the soul , he only speaks truth . </s> if he claims he was part of goat , then he was at the time . </s> he has simply forgotten or no longer cares . </s> having watched scar for some time now , i feel and fear that he is right . </s> only scar tells the truth , none else has the power . </s>
with an audience of one , i have clothed my nakedness and quake to bare my soul , though i think this is what entropy asks . </s> but what and who are you , darkness ? </s> i dread our next encounter and long for it at once . </s> do you teach lessons or learn from me , or do we dance together at an awkward remove ? </s> i confine myself to watch and wait , terrified at the final play . </s>	i sought to awaken man to higher potential , but only spun the day to a frenzy greater than i could imagine . </s> my motive was good , i feel , but does good motive lead to good result ? </s> age brings a hard insight : each answer is no answer at all , but merely a field of further questions . </s> perhaps scar jones is the real goat zero . </s> only he could create this impossible scene out of such a hoax . </s>
i lack the instinct which is all that scar possesses . </s> ruthless , scar faces down pretense . </s> it is a thing he can not tolerate . </s> he seeks and finds it with inhuman instinct , or perhaps with the penetrating sight of the mad . </s> he reveals , it seems to me , the deceit in us all and altogether in this modern age . </s>	the illusion of television and computers rules us and the love of our children vanishes like a dream . </s> for my part , these wolves that trail upon him should ask scar questions of a spiritual nature . </s> his philosophy should be sought . </s> he is easy to condemn for his vulgarity and violence , but easy to forgive for his perspicacity . </s> when he slapped a woman who offered herself to him in the service of her career , he favored her . </s>
it was an act of dark mercy ; he begged her to awaken . </s> how did he know she made the offer for that reason ? </s> yet we know , why shouldnt he ? </s> we almost think she earned it ; i for one , long that it did her good . </s> sometimes a slap is the answer ; sometimes being struck is our only approach to veritas . </s>	she did not deserve it principally for the sacrifice of her soul , but for her subterfuge on a being innocent to falsehood . </s> scar is a madman who sees a deeper nature . </s> what else can explain his bizarre approach ? </s> he is this age commenting upon itself , an awful man loved by the universe . </s> he is a beautiful brute in a death arena , thriving on glory , yet caring nothing for it . </s>
the amazing magic of scar is that he is beyond mistake . </s> he does nothing right , therefore , he commits no wrong . </s> we see scar jones in all his beautiful derangement , a voice of the epoch whose vulgar idiom strikes at the heart of mendacity . </s> i perceive a hidden truth ; he has no pride . </s> his other emotions , though overwhelming from the outside , i think are little more than phantoms to him . </s>	a steady constant play , most infuriating in its richness , he moves from state to state with a casual ease . </s> he is not the slave of perceptions . </s> but neither is he the master . </s> he greets each moment with a fresh spirit . </s> his vulgarity , is it intended to shock , or betray , or to set him apart ? </s>
how does one answer for his crude , back-alley demeanor ? </s> it needs no answer . </s> it requires no cause . </s> we can let it be as it is . </s> does it subtract or add to his message , if such a message exists ? </s>	to my mind , it is the message , that the bald and overstated finds our personal social limit so readily . </s> we worship scar behind glass ; in person , he would be unbearable . </s> scars instinct finds the point where the person before him needs to and can increase , but painful such augment . </s> he nails the weak opening . </s> those who relate to scar well , and by this i mean undefended , curious , even intrigued , are strengthened by the encounter . </s>
something happens . </s> they germinate ; they blossom . </s> they arrive . </s> perhaps the abrasion of his text acts as sandpaper , smoothing the roughness of the character , grinding away the grotesque polish of those in his wake . </s> we have seen his moments of naked regret . </s>	scar , feeling badly , is a noble soul . </s> we can not doubt such moments ; he never lies . </s> and that is our principle gauge of respect for him : not that he tells no lies , but that he never feels the urge . </s> his scenes of remorse i watch repeatedly : the false funeral , the child in the pool , the theater worker bursting out crying . </s> utterly human moments , they move me to tears , and not because of contrast with his seeming other self , not because of innocence hidden within the beast . </s>
i am moved because that flavor is always there . </s> hes trying to help , strange as it seems . </s> each act is kindness , because of the brutal honesty conveyed . </s> no one else offers so much frankness . </s> genuineness is his message and how could we clean scars speech and leave that in place ? </s>	our guts reveal we could not . </s> scar shows what we all fear to recognize : social politeness is dishonest . </s> we hide behind it our actual sentiment . </s> if we lack compassion for scar , we lack insight about the worst within us , and thus have left behind the best . </s> defense scar walked into the court of law . </s>
he was gon na defend hisself . </s> couldnt trust nobody else anyway . </s> he must of said it enough , cause wasnt nobody else acting like his fin and he knew theyd be glad to do it . </s> but fuck em . </s> he was gon na kick some ass , too . </s>	he wore a hawaiian shirt , white linen pants and a super stylish straw hat he had em buy special for the day . </s> somebody reminded him about the clothes when they told him he had to go to court . </s> he wanted to know why and they told him a bunch of reasons , finspeak mostly , but the words public endangerment and reckless conduct and the like kept coming up . </s> well , he was who he was , why pretend ? </s> then they said something about aggravated assault and manslaughter and he didnt think that sounded like him so much . </s>
probably a case of mistook identity . </s> pi grabbed his arm on the way in and he remembered her . </s> he was getting to like her an awful lot . </s> take this . </s> she put a pill on his tongue . </s>	he swallowed it off no liquid , hardly slowed walking . </s> some spinner in the doorway asked him for a comment about killing some jerk badger and scar yelled that he hadnt killed nobody . </s> scar started causing a ruckus , like usual , only he didnt want to . </s> scar respected the courts of law . </s> they were a good thing and if a man was going to get justice in this country , this was the place . </s>
it failed , sure , as often as not , any system did , but then , outta nowhere , it succeeded for the solitary man . </s> somebody was trying somewhere . </s> nothing better . </s> the judge was a female . </s> that was good , scar could charm her up and help get himself an unbiased verdict . </s>	a lot of people said a homeless nigger couldnt get no decent justice , but he was about to prove em all wrong . </s> scar jones , please rise . </s> he stood up . </s> are you that woman judge whats on tv ? </s> no . </s>

she rolled her eyes and laughed like he was good crazy and scar knew he could talk to her . </s> im trying something fierce . </s> can you just call me scar ? </s> its all i ask . </s> i cant- you laughed , he said . </s>	now come on , tell mewhat were you laughing about ? </s> she patted her hair and sighed real deep , then pinched her nose at the top . </s> what if i call you mister scar ? </s> i figure that oughtta fly . </s> she told him fine and to be quiet while the bailiff read the charges and he stood there and listened and it went on for a good , long time , but most of it just sounded like hed been having himself some fun and nobodyd really got hurt , so he started to doubt the efficacity of the legislation , but he knew that wasnt her fault . </s>
judges didnt make laws , they just enforced em . </s> the dude charged him with something called gross public endagerment , and he protested cause he didnt want to hurt nobody , but that judge rode him down to the dirt with her eyes . </s> she was tough and didnt have to say nothing and he shut up even though they was telling lies all about him . </s> they accused him of stabbing an alleged policeman and scar had to interrupt and ask what that even meant and the rest of them people must of thought so too , cause the judge said something and they started buzzing and talking like crazy . </s> you heard that right , the judge said . </s>	somesituation occurred at the morgue and it was covered up . </s> the body disappeared . </s> boy , that set em all to yammering behind him , at least until she banged that wooden hammer again and they got quiet , but then she really set em on fire . </s> it further appears that the man in question wasnt who he appeared . </s> officer blake johnson of the washington , d.c. police department never existed . </s>
the situation was concealed . </s> some of em left , whipping out their little phones and poking buttons like they was important . </s> he turned and let em know that hed told em he hadnt killed nobody and the judge got up on him banging her wooden hammer again , but he didnt turn back right away , he kept eye contact on em . </s> he said he was sorry for outbursting and how he didnt like sitting with them a-holes behind him . </s> youre actually somewhat of a wise man . </s>	but back to the point : somebodys quite good at this game . </s> if there had been a defending attorney , the manslaughter and related charges probably would have been dropped twenty minutes ago when i met in chambers with legal counsel . </s> as mister jo- , mister scar is self-representing and declined to attend , only the prosecuting attorney was there . </s> consequently , the charges remained in effect . </s> the prosecutor wants to keep them so . </s>
somebody , he claims , died that day from mister scars actions . </s> now , mister scar , i suggest you seek competent counsel . </s> you mean hire myself a fin ? </s> no , maam , fuck them bloodsuckers . </s> any one of em would eat their own grandma for a snack . </s>	i can understand that . </s> i am one and sometimes i dont like myself . </s> scar laughed and so did the courtroom . </s> you can sit down now , mister scar . </s> any way you can make it just plain ole scar ? </s>
no . </s> you have a certain charm about you mister scar . </s> please dont abuse that here . </s> he sat down . </s> prosecution , call the witness . </s>	two or three dudes said what he yanked a badge off some pretend cop and jabbed it into his neck with malicious intent , but scar didnt think he had and not like they said cause it didnt sound like him . </s> he had to yell out how it was a lie and get told to sit down a few times . </s> then somebody grabbed his arm . </s> pi , he yelled . </s> the judge fussed on him and pi walked past , around the front of the table and stood beside him . </s>

the judge was looking at him , interested , but she didnt stop that lying fool up in the box from yapping his lies about scar . </s> pi nodded at her and she rolled her hands out like it was cool and scar asked her what she thought she was doing . </s> she told him to keep his voice down cause it was a courtroom and the testimony and all and they better write notes , but scar told her he didnt like doing that for a number of reasons . </s> then the judge called her counsel and told her what she oughta keep him restrained . </s> it had to be done , so scar said she wasnt his counsel cause he didnt want none and hed heard where a man better keep his own counsel and he was going to , so the judge said she might better just sit there and be his friend and scar liked that just fine . </s>	apparently , pi didnt think so , cause she asked for a fifteen minute recess as shed come across some special information and was new to the situation and needed to converse with her friend . </s> she meant him . </s> scars watch beeped and somebody handed pi a note . </s> shit . </s> he yelled the stupid line from the watch , it sure was bugging him . </s>
the sweet terrain of madness is our friend . </s> dreamlike , we perform , no obstacle to invent . </s> the judge asked if he plead insanity and he told her no , he was just reading his watch cause it was gon na keep buzzing him till he did and why would he plead insanity when he wasnt even crazy ? </s> after she put her glasses on the table , pi told the judge she needed to take the stand , but the judge said that werent the way it worked , that counsel couldnt do that and scar jumped in and said she wasnt his fin , she was his friend . </s> pi pulled some electro gizmo out of her pocket and read it and said she was the only one what could bear witness to something or other and they bapped it back and forth with scar loving the cat fight , but then the judge finally said it was irregular and let her get on with it , but she couldnt be counsel no more . </s>	she called him mister jones , but he was busy and she asked if he was reading his watch again and he told her he was and said it would help him get through cause it was telling him some good stuff to say . </s> he told her there was some kind of precedent for what they were doing and he could relinquish the advisement and she could determine its neutrality that there wasnt no conflict of interest regarding the defendant before reinstating counsel . </s> scar cleared up that pi was just being his friend and told the judge that he wasnt gon na take nobody else sitting at that little table with him . </s> she said thatd be fine and pi took the stand . </s> they sat there all stupid until the judge told him he was gon na have to examine her and he told her he didnt have no doctor bag to examine her with and she said question and he told her it wasnt nothing but a joke . </s>

ill consider it a professional courtesy that you allowed me to use it without cruelly pointing out my gross lack of skill and subtlety . </s> it was awfully kind of you . </s> and , you might notice , im doing the same professional favor by not taking your lives as i promised . </s> you arent in my level of play for that sort of thing and it just wouldnt be fair . </s> now , please point your camera into this room . </s>	holy shit . </s> killers staging area was a large storage room . </s> it looked like a gun show display with a rustic theme . </s> twenty-four weapons lined the back wall , each lovingly mounted using large nails , barrels pointing up and to the left . </s> two columns , rifles right side , handguns left side . </s>
four slots stood empty , two of each . </s> ammunition in neat stacks lined the walls . </s> did you know that a pistol , at least in american usage , is not synonymous with a handgun ? </s> its a subset . </s> a pistol has an integrated barrel and chamber . </s>	a revolver is not a pistol , but it is a handgun . </s> how about that ? </s> all of these handguns are , however , pistols . </s> look at this model . </s> squarehead took a glock and held it in front of the camera . </s>
excellent . </s> its loaded . </s> now heres a little bit of movie magic bullshit . </s> squarehead fired the gun between them and they jerked back . </s> dont drop the camera . </s>	were filming for a reason . </s> now , as i was saying , the bullshit . </s> did you hear that ? </s> i mean before the bullet , when i cocked the gun ? </s> they shook their heads no . </s>
you know why ? </s> because it didnt happen . </s> this gun has an internal hammer . </s> you dont cock it . </s> they cut that sound in there where it doesnt belong . </s>	he shook his head . </s> hollywood . </s> its a glock 19c . </s> it takes a luger 9 mil and has a 153 millimeter barrel , which , as you can see , is quite long . </s> some people use hollow points . </s>
i never use them myself . </s> why not ? </s> too easy to accidentally kill . </s> a hollow point can kill a man with a shot to the arm . </s> anyway , this particular model is meant for something farther away . </s>	most of these are . </s> what would you speculate about the methods of this gun owner ? </s> hes a sharpshooter . </s> exactly , three points for you . </s> now , what might that indicate about his weaknesses ? </s>
he doesnt like close range . </s> you arent an infighter . </s> me ? </s> who said we were talking about me ? </s> you did , the pr guy said . </s>	he thought , then flicked his eyes to squarehead . </s> no , you didnt . </s> no . </s> i didnt . </s> there was a long silence . </s>
what are we here for ? </s> is killer the real goat ? </s> well , it looks hard to dispute at this point , doesnt it ? </s> squarehead turned to replace the pistol on the wall . </s> he lectured more on the various types of weapons and their uses . </s>	there was a loud crack and the sound of a body dropping to the floor , then the cameraman shouted , oh , jesus christ , who are you ? </s> the hammer of a gun clicked back . </s> squarehead didnt turn . </s> are you going to kill him ? </s> why not ? </s>
please dont . </s> please . </s> i have a wife , two kids and a dog . </s> what year are you from , mister suburb ? </s> i dont have any of that shit . </s>	my life is crap compared to yours . </s> why shouldnt i kill you ? </s> youd kill a man because youre jealous ? </s> squarehead asked . </s> is there a better reason ? </s>

quick , easy , and safe . </s> smart , too , its what youre good at . </s> specializing is excellent , but not to the detriment of general skills . </s> you havent got hand to hand , knife work , coms skills , team assault , infiltration , and a host of others . </s> do you really want this or not ? </s>	because i see an obsessive who isnt willing to branch out . </s> youve nailed the sniper work . </s> youre the best , maybe , right now , the best in the world . </s> from what i see here , youre good with a long-barrel pistol , too . </s> can you hit two diametrically opposite targets of one point five centimeters from twenty feet in under a second ? </s>
what does that mean ? </s> the cameraman asked . </s> standard gage for expert level pistol skill . </s> yes , i can . </s> then you can control a sizable crowd . </s>	rely on that . </s> when the time comes , your training will be all that holds you from mistakes based on being scared shitless . </s> are you gon na kill this guy or what ? </s> sounds like i need to do something different . </s> what do you recommend ? </s>
think for your goddamn self . </s> you are so close to what you really want . </s> i want it for you , too , thats what this is all about . </s> now figure it out . </s> im not your momma . </s>	do i want to kill goats ? </s> what are the mission objectives ? </s> good question . </s> have they changed ? </s> what are they ? </s>
youre my c.o . </s> youre supposed to tell me . </s> no . </s> i do not necessarily tell you that . </s> not at all . </s>	you are a front line soldier , a fucking grunt . </s> if you know mission objectives , then you can , and will , reveal them under heavy interrogation . </s> not me . </s> bullshit and more . </s> everybody breaks under professional torture . </s>
you follow orders and my orders are : figure it out . </s> killer flipped the gun so he held it by the barrel , then pistol whipped the cameraman with the grip . </s> he fell to the floor with a scream , then went unconscious with a second strike to the back of the head . </s> sloppy technique . </s> what was wrong with that ? </s>	should have taken one strike . </s> why did it take two ? </s> he was not even actively resisting . </s> i hit him in the wrong place . </s> wheres the right place ? </s>
back of the head . </s> be specific . </s> you couldnt hit the occipital ridge from the first angle . </s> there are two unproven but well-believed causes of unconsciousness from a blow . </s> both result in some level of trauma to the brain stem . </s>	with a two by four , hit them anywhere in the head . </s> twist that head sharp and fast . </s> the momentum does the work . </s> a pistol wont . </s> you dont have the mass , therefore , you dont have the momentum . </s>
a pistol hits sharp , not deep . </s> thats why it works to strike the base of the skull . </s> the medulla oblongata is right there , thats what gets knocked unconscious . </s> if you use the technique , know the mechanics . </s> fuck , i didnt know i had to be a doctor . </s>	you cant be a doctor . </s> doctors dont hurt people and you do . </s> what happens if you strike someone in the temple ? </s> depends on the severity . </s> hard as you can . </s>
fist or something else ? </s> something else . </s> this is a deadly business youre doing . </s> if youre fistfighting , youre going to lose . </s> use anything else . </s>	why ? </s> i dont want to injure myself . </s> exactly . </s> fists are terribly inefficient weapons and unbelievably vulnerable . </s> hands arent designed for hitting people . </s>
theyre for picking things up and using that to hit people . </s> finger bones are small , they break easy , and then the hand doesnt do shit but hurt like hell . </s> you cant use it anymore ! </s> what if there isnt anything to grab ? </s> theres always something . </s>	kick the knee crosswise . </s> its a quick , simple strike , tough to counter because you can pull back so easy , and brutally damaging . </s> you want that . </s> you dont want to cause pain , you want to cause permanent damage . </s> stomp the foot , hard . </s>
break the bones . </s> never , ever , kick above the knee . </s> hell grab your foot and break your other leg or your balls if hes any good . </s> these are surprise attacks . </s> real fights always are won by grapplers or stunning surprise strikes . </s>	get him down and choke him out . </s> bite him . </s> really , though , you shouldnt be in that situation . </s> if you are , youve already lost . </s> killer grunted . </s>
i got the first guy on the first hit . </s> good for you . </s> so what do you do now ? </s> killer started to cuff and gag them . </s> cross-cuff , back to back . </s>	squarehead showed him . </s> wrap the chains , then cuff right to right , left to left . </s> theyre helpless . </s> another way is to cuff his right hand to the others left foot and vice versa . </s> you can move them , but they cant do much . </s>
why do i want to move them ? </s> the pr agent had come around and was watching with terrified eyes . </s> the trunk . </s> word blaming http// : goat : zero there is a quite virulent strain of disease now which i designate word-blaming . </s> the three terms which spring to the fore are : bitch , cunt , and nigger . </s>	read how bold they appear , like thugs at a formal ball . </s> what might they have , these terms . </s> and more besides , but we need not enumerate the spics and fotzes ( a vagina reference , and the foulest of german words . ) </s> i am more curious about their power than their legion . </s> on the coarser level of analysis , they offend many . </s>
especially women . </s> why do men , in general , tolerate cursing with ease ? </s> perhaps it suggests violence , or an acceptance of it . </s> women are mostly helpless against physical aggression , of course they fear it . </s> yet they are only words . </s>	in my opinion , the once mighty f-word has slipped in glory . </s> not even in the top three , such a common word . </s> by my reckoning , the most vile is the n-word . </s> but , is nigger a curse word ? </s> properly , no , but it evokes a similar feeling in most instances . </s>
the c-word , however , carries more pain for women specifically . </s> an interesting topic of debate , but i prefer the following twist upon it : there are groups of people who would never say the c-word , but readily say the n-word . </s> a southern grandfather , for example , might speak of niggers as casually as flies , but would never say the c-word . </s> there are another group who would say the c-word , but never the n-word , certain earthy liberal elements , often the grandchildren of the previous . </s> yet they are only words . </s>	there is a deeper symptom behind them . </s> but the message is serious enough . </s> people mistake the n-word for racism itself . </s> unable to cope with the vast , unwieldy blob of racial interplay , they collapse into fear of a word . </s> dont misunderstand , using this word in a hateful way is a terrible thing , but i speak of a more delicate mistake : believing the word is the thing itself . </s>
what if i spell it this way : nigga ? </s> is it a different word , or not ? </s> language will betray you if you rely on it too heavily , if you believe it is real . </s> a pervasive and absurd liberal sentiment , unspoken as well , is that removal of the word from society is removal of racism . </s> i overstate simplistically , but can you smell something accurate in the idea ? </s>	yet they are only words . </s> they can hurt , yes , they can inflame , absolutely , they can topple power in whispers . </s> but here is your surprise . </s> words have no existence at all . </s> first time on a plane three letters , no wait , shazam , you pay . </s>
he pointed at the slanty eye . </s> you coming , dude ? </s> free trip home . </s> we need a translator . </s> you speak it ? </s>	the dude nodded . </s> say yes , dammit , otherwise you seem weak and i know you people hate looking weak . </s> uh , yes . </s> was first language . </s> well , i can tell english wasnt . </s>
cool , man . </s> its a paid gig , then . </s> how does twenty grand a day sound ? </s> he didnt trust whoever he told to pay for the trip , so he told another one to figure out the food . </s> he didnt want the first one to have that much power . </s>	scar sat down in the big seats at the front of the plane . </s> he figured he had two first class seats and if he didnt , some spinner better change that . </s> he bet they had the whole plane anyway . </s> where we going ? </s> japan . </s>
