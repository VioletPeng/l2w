i think we have to get down in the city , at least at first anyway , just to see what there is . </s> like gary said , who knows ? </s> could be that the police are still there , or at least someone in authority . '' </s> `` nice pipe dream , '' gary returned . </s> `` you 're probably right , '' john answered , `` but i would bet that glow we could see across the lake last night was rochester , and if it was , that means the power is at least still on . </s>	they just gave the okay last year to rochester gas and electric to fire up that new nuclear plant out in livingston county . '' </s> `` where 's that , '' frank asked . </s> `` well , rochester is in monroe county , livingston county starts out past henrietta , which is a small suburb of rochester . </s> it 's maybe fifteen miles or so away from the city itself , i guess . </s> there was a lott'a bitching when they first proposed it , but it ended up being built anyway . </s>
anyway , i 'm starting to sound like gary now i guess . </s> the whole thing 's computerized from top to bottom . </s> oh they have people working there , but they 're only there in case something goes wrong , not to run the place . </s> even if something does go wrong , the computer shuts the whole thing down , not people . </s> they supply electric for the entire city with it , with some to spare . </s>	all the excess power that the place produces gets sold to new york city . </s> they built a new plant to handle it downtown , on broad street . </s> it 's a ways from the lake , so if that was rochester we saw last night , the plant must still be up and running . </s> that means there may still be some sort of control there , you know , police , or something , at least other people i would guess anyway ... '' `` ... you know , i think i am becoming a gary clone . </s> i guess i should get back to what i was saying before i started running at the mouth . </s>
fairport looks like the best route in . </s> we can get off at webster and shoot across 250 straight into fairport , and from there we have several routes to choose from . </s> there are quite a few loops that surround the city , can-of-worms it 's called . </s> most of the traffic would be there . </s> they rebuilt the whole system just a few years back so it would be easier to get around the city . </s>	almost all of the old routes in and out were pretty much secondary after that , you know , really light traffic . </s> but all of those routes in should be pretty well open . '' </s> gary traced the route on the map as john spoke . </s> `` looks good to me too , '' he said . </s> `` looks like we can get pretty much anywhere on the east side of the city from there . '' </s>
`` we can , '' john agreed , `` but do n't let that map fool you . </s> it 's not as straight forward as it appears . </s> i think we 'll head out on east avenue from fairport . </s> try that first , and see . '' </s> gary looked for east avenue on the map , but could n't find it . </s>	`` thirty one , '' john said . </s> `` route 31 ? </s> gary asked . </s> `` yes , straight out of fairport . </s> it 's really east avenue still to me , but i think they list it as route 31 on the map , '' john said . </s>
`` got it , '' gary replied . </s> `` it does n't go straight in anymore like the map shows , '' john warned , `` they changed it . </s> but it goes far enough to hit winton road . '' </s> `` according to the map , '' gary said , `` it 'll take us north or south , and that opens a lot of ways in to the city . '' </s> `` sounds like a done deal , '' frank said , as he turned on the air conditioning in the jeep . </s>	`` hey , '' gary said , `` do n't you feel a little guilty driving around in a stolen jeep with the air on ? '' </s> `` nope , if you 're gon na steal something make it something nice , i always say , '' frank replied , with a smug look on his face . </s> `` besides , it 's getting hotter out , is n't it ?

cold in the mornings , usually , even this time of year . </s> summer does n't last for long , and i guess i expected it to stay cooler here too . '' </s> `` it does stay cooler , or at least it did , '' gary said . </s> `` it can get hot in the summers , maybe edge up to the eighties , even low nineties on very rare occasions , but not this high . </s> i really got ta believe that there 's another reason for it . </s>	could be its heat from the missiles , depends on where they hit , but i really doubt it . </s> maybe frank 's right , maybe the poles have changed . </s> of course its right back to the friggin ' scientists you know , '' he continued , `` only time will tell on that one , i guess . </s> remember that japanese island that had the quake about five , six years ago ? '' </s> `` i did a short article on that , '' frank said . </s>
`` moved it , right ? '' </s> `` about six feet , '' john said , `` and that was just a quake , not a nuclear blast . </s> who 's to say what a large blast would do ? </s> or several large blast 's for that matter ? </s> i do n't pretend to know . '' </s>	`` i do n't guess we 'll be finding that out right away , '' annie said . </s> `` no ... more wait and see , '' gary said . </s> `` i 'd sure like to get my hands on a compass though , but who knows if a compass could tell us much ? </s> probably not anymore , i 'd guess . </s> shit , where the hell can you find a good scientist when you need one ? '' </s>
everyone laughed , breaking the tension that had been building , as it always did , when the conversation turned serious . </s> `` hey , '' frank said , as he thrust his open hand over the seat back , towards the rear . </s> `` you guys hogging all the beer back there ? </s> no wonder you 're both starting to sound like a couple of fifth grade scientists . '' </s> gary laughed as he passed frank another beer . </s>	`` your license , '' he said . </s> `` guy 's ? '' </s> annie asked . </s> she waited until they looked at her . </s> `` well , i was wondering , if , well ... </s>
when we get to oswego , if we could stop and get some clean clothes ? </s> i 've been in these for two days now , and if there 's no one there , in oswego , i mean , i 'd like to stop and get some clean ones . '' </s> frank looked down at his dirty shirt ; he could use some clean clothes too . </s> he had tossed the suit coat , and the tie had gone the same way , but the white shirt he had put on three days ago was still on , and it looked it . </s> come to think of it , he thought , we could all use some clean clothes . </s>	and a shower would n't be bad either . </s> aloud , he said , `` i vote yes , does anyone know where there 's a shopping center , a mall ? '' </s> `` there 're a couple just inside the city limits , '' john said , `` they should have just about anything you 'd want . '' </s> `` it would probably be a good idea to stop , '' gary said . </s> `` it would give us all a chance to clean up too . </s>
of course that 's if there 's running water . '' </s> `` even if there is n't , '' annie said , `` there 's the lake , right ? '' </s> `` true enough , '' gary replied , `` but we may not be able to get close to it . </s> i 'll hope for running water myself .
