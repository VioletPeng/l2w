keeping it under wraps was tough , but trolls had some ethics , so the cover held . </s> the real method was to never express opinions , but have the actuals do it based on the almost insipid vagueness of the trolling notions . </s> the topics stretched as all those muggles fell to the power of the trolls weirding ways . </s> wave one had a master player . </s> he hit llort with a low-level flame , saying that in any history , alternate or not , sorcerers could not possibly be descended from monkeys . </s>	if so , how could they drive suvs ? </s> one of the loose cannons escalated to full kooking based on the post . </s> he got banned , but llort lobbied for his return based on freedom of speech . </s> he kooked again and was mostly ignored from then on . </s> they eventually crashed three of the groups . </s> 	 cross-topicality was llorts specialty and ultimate masterpiece . </s> after the potter suv wars , he moved to solo pastures , and herded , in a ring , fourteen groups from ultra-conservative to ultra-liberal and continuing back to the first group . </s> a white supremacist usenet group was led , in twos and threes to a right wing southern baptist usenet which he migrated to a return the confederacy group . </s> the next was tricky . </s> the confederates raided a southern gentlemans sporting group which dealt largely with horses . </s>	he slid them into a polo group , where he almost lost the whole project to a flame war : the damn polo yankees against the well-heeled rednecks . </s> the preppies rolled nicely to an equestrian site . </s> he found a farmers blog and the equestrians took it over . </s> an organic animal farming spot drew off the lost souls of farmer dean and the organics happily jumped to an animal rights activist group which grumbled their way to a native americans kill animals with dignity group , alt.usenet.indianbuffalo . </s> they invaded a group devoted to coin collecting called buffalo nickel . </s> 	 getting users to cross the technically intimidating blog to usenet line was tough , but he encouraged people to try this cool new group , where people really knew their stuff . </s> he parlayed the coin collectors into a collectors in general group and they bumped to a gun collectors spot which grumbled but took a new home from some hunters who commandeered an nra subsite where a natural step led back to the original white supremacy group . </s> a water-wheel , he called it . </s> it was a proud piece of work , and the circle kept slowly turning with little effort once he closed the loop . </s> another troll named it the superconductor effect . </s>	at the end of each week , he posted you have all been trolled . </s> you are idiots . </s> the replies read ignore him , hes a troll , and , please dont feed the troll . </s> others soon topped his design with the figure eight which used one group for two migration points . </s> the new trolling was to keep groups functioning and keep people migrating . </s> 	 shepherd trolling , rather than destruction trolling . </s> after that , trolling lost interest . </s> llort wanted to live his life and pursue his career so he found a massive online urban fantasy game called boston commons where he enrolled at harvard university . </s> something else happened that looked cool . </s> he got a business card from a smelly homeless guy wearing an eye patch . </s>	he said his name was scar jones , or goat , he wasnt very clear . </s> but the card was . </s> he checked out the website . </s> it was an invitation to set up a blog and be part of a crazy super-anonymous puzzle-game . </s> it looked easy and fun , so he signed up as goat.troll . </s> 	 blog live entropy controlled the internet , as much as anyone could . </s> he did so with a four hundred million node botnet , spread throughout home and business computers all over the globe . </s> he got a card from scar personally , and was building a plan , based on the goat blog stunt . </s> it would make headline news in every part of the world . </s> he tasked the botnet to search for goat himself . </s>	it hit dead-ends . </s> he couldnt find the originator in one hour and he wanted to give goat a medal for it . </s> entropy was very hard to hide from . </s> he dropped the search , then decided he wanted to not know . </s> while he was waiting for opening day , entropy griefed . </s>
