i think we have to get down in the city , at least at first anyway , just to see what there is . </s> like gary said , who knows ? </s> could be that the police are still there , or at least someone in authority . '' </s> `` nice pipe dream , '' gary returned . </s> `` you 're probably right , '' john answered , `` but i would bet that glow we could see across the lake last night was rochester , and if it was , that means the power is at least still on . </s>	they just gave the okay last year to rochester gas and electric to fire up that new nuclear plant out in livingston county . '' </s> `` where 's that , '' frank asked . </s> `` well , rochester is in monroe county , livingston county starts out past henrietta , which is a small suburb of rochester . </s> it 's maybe fifteen miles or so away from the city itself , i guess . </s> there was a lott'a bitching when they first proposed it , but it ended up being built anyway . </s> 	 anyway , i 'm starting to sound like gary now i guess . </s> the whole thing 's computerized from top to bottom . </s> oh they have people working there , but they 're only there in case something goes wrong , not to run the place . </s> even if something does go wrong , the computer shuts the whole thing down , not people . </s> they supply electric for the entire city with it , with some to spare . </s>	all the excess power that the place produces gets sold to new york city . </s> they built a new plant to handle it downtown , on broad street . </s> it 's a ways from the lake , so if that was rochester we saw last night , the plant must still be up and running . </s> that means there may still be some sort of control there , you know , police , or something , at least other people i would guess anyway ...

'' </s> gary traced the route on the map as john spoke . </s> `` looks good to me too , '' he said . </s> `` looks like we can get pretty much anywhere on the east side of the city from there . '' </s> 	 `` we can , '' john agreed , `` but do n't let that map fool you . </s> it 's not as straight forward as it appears . </s> i think we 'll head out on east avenue from fairport . </s> try that first , and see . '' </s> gary looked for east avenue on the map , but could n't find it . </s>	`` thirty one , '' john said . </s> `` route 31 ? </s> gary asked . </s> `` yes , straight out of fairport . </s> it 's really east avenue still to me , but i think they list it as route 31 on the map , '' john said . </s> 	 `` got it , '' gary replied . </s> `` it does n't go straight in anymore like the map shows , '' john warned , `` they changed it . </s> but it goes far enough to hit winton road . '' </s> `` according to the map , '' gary said , `` it 'll take us north or south , and that opens a lot of ways in to the city . '' </s> `` sounds like a done deal , '' frank said , as he turned on the air conditioning in the jeep . </s>	`` hey , '' gary said , `` do n't you feel a little guilty driving around in a stolen jeep with the air on ? '' </s> `` nope , if you 're gon na steal something make it something nice , i always say , '' frank replied , with a smug look on his face . </s> `` besides , it 's getting hotter out , is n't it ? '' </s> he asked , turning the conversation back to something more serious . </s> `` i mean i 'm from washington of course , and you never know what it 's going to be like there . </s>
