it reminded of fellatio in an airplane bathroom , both hidden and exposed , exciting and irreversibly shameful . </s> but enough oppositery , it is a perfidious approach of course the new york times revealed the answer . </s> it was no coincidence , and now , i only feel exposed . </s> the trickster is tricked and the plan everyone saw , which to the creator me appeared a cosmic beautiful chance , reveals itself , a deeper plan after all . </s> my scheme is co-opted by a greater mind . </s>	i feel a fool and an uneasy fear . </s> is this entity , who is capable of manipulating and controlling so much , an enemy or a friend ? </s> why need i make him one or the other ? </s> ( why assume its him , anyway ? ) </s> perhaps it is a teacher , reminding me of the middle way . </s>
and what might that be ? </s> if an actual reader existed , i would avoid this topic . </s> it is , for no reason , embarrassing , but this is for me alone , therefore i proceed . </s> i shall approach the topic from the other side . </s> on wikipedia today , i found an entry called the law of the excluded middle . </s>	it is a thing i know much of , and as a buddhist , a thing i can not tolerate . </s> it presupposes that yes and no are the only possible answers and is a pervasive error in perception and reasoning , especially in the west . </s> damn the greeks , for after so many years , i can not defeat the instinct to think in such a way , though i can prove it untrue through any number of casual exercises . </s> this law has caused more damage to an accurate perception of the world than anything i can think of . </s> the middle way , obviously , is neither yes nor no . </s>
it is not both , it is not neither . </s> nor is it maybe . </s> all of these are ideas , and thus unable to capture the true reality . </s> but this topic is too large for a single blog posting . </s> it is inherent in all my posts and i will touch on it , connecting it to the issues at hand as best i am able . </s>	in the middle way , wisdom resides . </s> end of digression . </s> i am proved by my own cunning to be an idiot at last . </s> but happily so ; i blame no one . </s> there was no mal-intent , at least in this massive jest upon my jest , i believe . </s>
the confidence game , if that is a proper term , was not designed to make me feel an imbecile , as indeed it did , though only in my own eyes . </s> however , now that i have the worlds attention , i want to claim it instead of living in shadow . </s> but only by staying nameless do i merit any decent regard . </s> to step forth is to deny my own ethic . </s> if i burst my anonymity and brave the scorn , fury and useless adulation , one of the great powers of our day , this mad world would put me where i belong , at the footnote of an unimportant page . </s>	i would become the gilligan of this century . </s> yet i crave fame , which offers a worthless clue to my true name . </s> how could i not , being american ? </s> i neither despise nor laud my nation . </s> the truth is , i can never escape . </s>
how long can our people lay claim to greatness ? </s> a few more days on historys calendar ? </s> rome lasted over a thousand years , china far longer still . </s> but this empire spends itself so rapidly . </s> the powerful destruction of our most fearsome tool or toy , the atomic bomb , is the perfect symbol of our nation . </s>	bright with ruin , america rages , tearing culture to its image , unable to control or contain the greed of its child , capitalism . </s> the beast has run amok . </s> how do most manage the insecure bravado of citizenry under the mightiest nation on earth ? </s> i am no hidden communist , i have long since surrendered to americas gruesome hegemony . </s> though i have vowed poverty , in my heart i crave wealth . </s>
regarding money , i ask only that in my next life , i am free of such desire . </s> it is a crucial step along a genuine path . </s> why did i create goat ? </s> does the banner say it all : to become the most famous anonymous in history ? </s> of course not . </s>	that was a sound bite . </s> though we may ( and should always ) question our own motive , i believe the true intent was to protect . </s> the thing protected i can not name , but will try . </s> independence of spirit . </s> perhaps collective action with no possible reward and with no common aim . </s>
perhaps i sought the unifying , binding thread that runs throughout humanity . </s> whatever , it seemed like a good idea . </s> actually , it seemed a great idea . </s> now , i am left with pieces of my creation over which i have no control . </s> i am a mother whose child has become psychotic . </s>	this has always been my way , to run a plan out , heedless of effect , believing , in my pride , that i am strong . </s> but that pride fails and turns to ash and that strength reveals itself as empty in essence when i taste the bitter fruit . </s> in this , i am always self-deceived . </s> within every consequence there lies some edge of pain . </s> i may achieve the goal of the most famous anonymous ( perhaps i am bested by the unknown soldier , whose fame was incidental to his acts ) . </s>
like an ironic lesson to a moral book , the success has left me hollow , and afraid . </s> what is the point of all the hard lessons of life ? </s> do we carry them into the grave ? </s> is new knowledge gained when the fire of suffering burns off the husk of self-illusion ? </s> do we grow ? </s>	are we reborn with greater strength ? </s> the kabbalah claims we live a cycle of twelve lives and arrive at the culmination of the spirit divine . </s> but that would suggest that every twelfth person is close and all my senses tell me that is not so . </s> i believe it never ends . </s> no tale is ever fully told . </s>
again , why goat ? </s> if you must have an answer , then 500 others were involved . </s> why did they do so ? </s> for me , i wanted to change the world . </s> i admit it , there , i am unmasked , at last seen to be a nave dreamer disattuned to our common reality . </s>	but therein lies a pristine message . </s> we are all disattuned ; it is a particular modern malady . </s> disconnected from earth by the sterility of our dwellings and skyscrapers , we base our sanity upon empty measure . </s> even farmers with their giant machines are far removed from the land compared to their cousins in history . </s> we have focused on wealth and possessions to the exclusion of all else . </s>
i have said it before and will again : money is a terrible answer . </s> but it is the loudest we have . </s> what of the gentle soul , living in bare subsistence , happy to hear the message of the wind , knowing the plants and animals and the cycle of their existence ? </s> this man or woman feels the interconnected , the subtle play of their own organism . </s> not hiding from the actuality of death , they dwell in the depths of life . </s>	we see those who live off the grid as crackpots , deluded by non-participation . </s> but living in tune with the land is participating in something deeper , the lasting timeless flow of existence rather than the ephemeral candle flame of man . </s> our civilization has lasted some 8000 of the planets fifteen billion years , and few believe we have 8000 more . </s> humanity is doomed . </s> certainly , this is no new message . </s>
i make no attempt to startle or alarm . </s> everyone knows it . </s> no one believes the human race will survive , yet we never speak of it . </s> if there is any original notion here , it is this : why do we ignore this awful truth ? </s> recruit entropy contacted squarehead on-voice . </s>	although it had never been stated explicitly , they both understood : voice contact meant alpha orders , imminent priority . </s> put goat on high radar . </s> make it big news . </s> how , captain ? </s> however you want . </s>
but not a flash that goes away . </s> something with staying power . </s> repeated violence sounded that note . </s> squarehead decided to find the person , then fit the mission to him . </s> he hit some usenet groups looking for a gun nut . </s>	the guy who wanted to kill and could . </s> somebody not stupid . </s> he narrowed it to four with a top candidate . </s> he posted his hook on the usenet group and got a few responses . </s> -what do you think of this goat thing ? </s>

poverty http//goat : zero i would like to name this bit of posturing the goat zero blog , or more simply the zero blog . </s> why this blog ? </s> why this spectacle ? </s> i seek to understand myself and this furious land . </s> goat is a social experiment with two forks . </s>	first , a free-form commentary by scar jones on the world today , as defined by commercialism , television , and the internet . </s> we will see how it unfolds . </s> second , how am i a product of my culture ? </s> or , more precisely , how could i not be ? </s> where do my points of escape lie ? </s>
how can i be my own man , dodging the rigors of the tiny approach ? </s> i enact a fatal error ; i long to make a difference . </s> but that is of little consequence . </s> making mistake after mistake , i walk an unmistaken path . </s> where to begin ? </s>	let us commence our isolate paean to modernitys ills and ingenuity upon the central topic , that crux and lever of all our lives : money . </s> but i know little of it first-hand , so i will examine its opposite and , to most of the earths population , definition . </s> why is poverty such a grave insult to self-esteem ? </s> i have no ethical difficulty with money . </s> i do not believe money is the root of all evil nor love of money , as it is more accurately and less frequently quoted . </s>
my problem is personal . </s> money and i simply do not agree , in the manner of a stomach-ache . </s> the general consensus is that success is based on wealth , an idea not unique to the modern age . </s> typically it has been coupled with the title of nobility . </s> these days , if one is not good at money , one is deemed a failure . </s>	and i am not good at it . </s> but that isnt the part that aggrieves me . </s> my hostility towards it is that i believe i am a failure based on that logic . </s> i am helpless to disagree . </s> i suppose we need some central standard of value or the general populace wont know what to do with their social experience . </s>
people need , it seems , to rank themselves and others ( as if we were all search engine results , which we are ) . </s> of course , there exist subcultures , social eddies , where the amount of money one has is not the principal measure of individual value . </s> but at some level , such ethic ever abides . </s> it is a fundamental american outlook , which the rest of the world can not quite grasp . </s> examine the next homeless man you see . </s>	try to conceive of him as a success and not a failure . </s> you can say or think the words , but the lie is put to the page by the absurdity of its resonance . </s> perhaps the man has gained a gauge to his own soul , based on his suffering , that the rest of us will never know , distracted as we are by goats and games and the empty flash of this sterile age . </s> though i do not enjoy it , it has great rewards : my vow of poverty is my self-punishment for being american . </s> it is , i think , a type of original sin . </s>
how can one not , should the world eat itself as it looks that it may , not blame the americans , even if that is oneself ? </s> for me , the blame prevails ; the only penance to have little . </s> thus i strive against that deeply planted greed , my native inheritance . </s> by my poverty , i ease my shame . </s> but the poverty , as i have said above , creates its own embarrassment . </s>	but i prefer this gauche state , it does not hide from me as would the other . </s> were i wealthy , i would most likely immerse myself within my possessions , pretending i have no honteuse american . </s> we can not really believe someone has succeeded without money to mark it . </s> that is the most horrible statement i can make about our day , for i know people of infinite kindness and tremendous wisdom . </s> i long to conceive of them as successful . </s>
they fulfill a far superior goal of life : they are decent human beings . </s> and yet , if they lack a great purse , i can not see them in the light they deserve . </s> i have been trained not to . </s> and why is it thus ? </s> so many of wealth and means live in pettiness and misery while so many without live in relative or even absolute joy . </s>	i tell all and myself , though neither listen , this pervasive outlook is the great blight of our day . </s> friends of mine know a billionaire and he feels , by all accounts , unworthy in his peerage because he possesses only a single , and not multiple , billions . </s> where does it end ? </s> my lesson is one that i can not seem to learn , but we all know logically . </s> it is an age old truth : wealth is not happiness . </s>
and the corollary : we can not stop seeking it no matter how bold this verity is drawn into our lives . </s> why ? </s> there is no longer a replacement . </s> religion may be the opiate of the masses , but no one really believes in god anymore , else why would act the way they do ? </s> where does that leave us in the west ? </s>	church is nothing but a social event for most . </s> we believe in rigorous science today and will accept nothing without proof . </s> except , we say , for god . </s> but not me . </s> god is a fraud . </s>
if he can not even communicate , then he is not real . </s> possibly he died long ago , or got lost , or forgot his way . </s> perhaps he no longer cares or never did . </s> it makes no difference . </s> god will not make me wealthy , no matter how much i trust in him . </s>	blame me if you must , but i can not make myself believe . </s> but to return to the topic at hand : if i can not afford a thing my mind tells me i need , the shadow of failure looms hard upon me . </s> how strange is that when i am doing what i love ? </s> i live in an abundance of ideas , blessings , and beautiful friends , yet the shameful stench of poverty is on me , like the odor of a dead rat . </s> no one approaches , save the feckless and the few , the tiny minority who value sanity above wealth . </s>
griefer llort lived in pawtucket , mass and hated it . </s> the place made him feel like an obese rat , so he spent most of his time on-line . </s> he linked in his goat.troll blog , but something kept breaking the link . </s> he wasnt a top-flight info-man , but this was too much . </s> it was scary . </s>	and it wasnt all . </s> llort was getting griefed in boston commons , his online game , by somebody whose name was an ellipsis followed by a long string of numbers . </s> coke adds life , the guy said . </s> buy us bonds . </s> then the icon appeared to slip and stabbed llorts in the belly with a butterknife . </s>

its different . </s> how ? </s> pis hip cocked and she leaned back in a sexy pose . </s> i really am curious . </s> llort didnt answer . </s>	care to know my full name ? </s> he shrugged . </s> its entropi . </s> i have a male aspect called entropy . </s> the icon morphed into a muscular man who knocked the door open and the orc down . </s>
he put his knee on the orcs chest , pulled a red army knife and held it to his throat . </s> youre a griefer , you just want to make my life suck . </s> this character took months of intensive gaming to develop . </s> i almost had tenure . </s> youre a dick . </s>	grow up . </s> youre a troll . </s> its just life . </s> sometimes people hate you for no reason . </s> youre lucky it didnt happen in-skin . </s>

this isnt the real game . </s> there is a character called professor llort in that game , but this is an exact copy of that game . </s> every move you make is duplicated here and there . </s> the only difference between the two is your password . </s> entropy put the beer to his lips , then stopped . </s>	until now . </s> whats the difference now ? </s> now hes dead . </s> what if i complain to the owners of the real boston commons ? </s> go ahead , youre talking to him . </s>

i need more . </s> how will i know you ? </s> ill have grey eyes and your balls in my hand . </s> the couch caught fire when she closed his office door . </s> atgo erzo entropy made the television commercial for goat , then plugged it over hundreds of legit commercials . </s>	it took some clever hacking and an inside connect to abc , but he managed to steal the first spot during the state of the union address . </s> for the first twenty-five seconds , the commercial showed a slowly rotating earth in space . </s> then , a loud thunk , and a red rubber stamp style word appeared at a diagonal stretching across the planet . </s> the word was goat , upside down and backward . </s> another commercial , which ran simultaneously on 750 cable stations nationwide , showed a goat eating grass . </s>
at the end it looked at the camera and bleated , youve been bad . </s> during and after , entropy searched for goat1 , not to establish identity , but to open a coms link . </s> he turned half of the 500 in thirty-six hours , but some were tight , had used internet cafes on the move , and posted only the one thing . </s> he suspected goat1 operated in a similar manner . </s> the software used to set up the blogs was bulletproof , too . </s>	no traces lay behind it for the goats . </s> he connected the design , though , to someone claiming to be female . </s> a tough cookie , he cracked into her operation after a few days . </s> her handle was pi . </s> atgo erzo , she said , and disappeared . </s>
the cracks were gone with her , then her operation vanished like smoke . </s> it had been a lure , for him . </s> the skin got a hard-on . </s> he anagrammed it : goat zero . </s> he found a dot zero domain with all ownership traces erased by an expert hand , most likely this pi . </s>	he wondered if she was an identity flipper , a man pretending , then decided she was actually his own femme fatale . </s> goat.zero . </s> he hit the address . </s> he got black and white note : this site is gone forever . </s> goat wasnt on the dot zero domain anywhere . </s>
the botnet turned it inside out , searching . </s> atgo erzo was listed as the originator , but that was not a real-name . </s> the real ownership traces were skillfully erased . </s> they had been minimal in the first place . </s> the botnet rolled up a blog entry by some guy on livejournal taking care of a chateau in france . </s>	entropy chuckled at the blog entry . </s> he had photos of a goat that had trapped itself on a high ledge with a story about how hard it was to get it down . </s> the post pre-dated the internet goat thing by two months . </s> entropy had the botnet cross-check the i.d.s with the 258 goats they had tracked to birth names . </s> the skin seldom knew birth names . </s>
he knew online handles and had the botnet keep the birth names secret from the skin . </s> he spent a few days carving out an expert system at goat finding . </s> it took about three seconds and it referenced chevre.goat , one of the 500 . </s> chevre was the french word for goat cheese . </s> chevre hadnt done much of anything as goat . </s>	he didnt seem to care . </s> entropy tied chevre.goat with the chateau caretaker . </s> they were the same . </s> it didnt look like the right person at all for goat zero , so entropy exposed him . </s> he used a hacker by the handle of toyz to go for a claim on the million , pointing at chevre.goat as the originator of the whole goat phenomenon . </s>
two days and forty major articles later , the goat watchers all knew that chevre was not the original . </s> meantime , entropy kept searching . </s> the botnet kicked him a news report of a sniping death . </s> the victim was one of the goats , goat.taog . </s> having started the taog domain just for the game , he was a computer engineer who drove a five speed porsche and bragged about being one of the goats . </s>	someone calling himself goat killer claimed credit for it . </s> squareheads operation . </s> two days later , another goat died and it made national news . </s> the next day , scar had his now legendary press conference . </s> he programmed the botnet to build a 20 billion set database cross-referenced to all non-base text entries , any headlines , titles or bloglines in the dot com . </s>
he did a drill-down into the data and pulled out a four-dimensional table with all permutations of goat and zero . </s> not bad , only 250 million . </s> he set the botnet loose on it . </s> pi watched him , he could feel her presence . </s> -hey , baby , quit looking over my shoulder . </s>	-why ? </s> -leave or help . </s> -did you check the zero domain ? </s> -cross-refd 14,287,000 permutations on dot zero , thanks . </s> -i mean the other zero domain . </s>
- ? ? ? </s> she left him with his dick in his hand . </s> what a player . </s> she didnt have his skills , but she sure had that thing to work at the grandmaster level . </s> entropy found no other zero domains . </s>	he checked for a domain with the numeral zero , with anagrams of zero , and with dot zer . </s> he tried zip , nada , zilch and hundreds of others . </s> nothing . </s> he scattered messages for pi across the net . </s> -more help . </s>

she checked out and blocked him . </s> entropy scanned the dark web for anagrams of goat zero . </s> he reprogrammed his botnet to find it , then diffused into the network space . </s> vastness beyond thought rolled through and out , extinguishing mind for fourteen hours thirty-seven minutes and twenty two seconds . </s> not in the dot . </s>	a colon ! </s> he thought it and the botnet found it in a picosecond : goat zero , using a colon instead of a period . </s> the colon was invisible . </s> finders keepers . </s> he organized his network for a take-over . </s>
