scar didnt hurt himself , though . </s> that was against his principles , so he just put himself in spots where he could be hurt . </s> more dudes was standing around , calling that dude by his name and saying to stomp on him . </s> the dude kicked him in the stomach and scar couldnt breathe and he thought he might drop away into the big orgasm the patch was giving him . </s> they turned away , so he stood up and started talking again , letting em know what a bunch of ball-licking queers they was . </s>	he kept going on until they jumped on him and he kept on telling him what he thought of em while they was punching and kicking on him . </s> they couldnt do too hard on him , though - they wasnt much of tough . </s> the bunch of goo-goos tied him to tree and he kept on yelling . </s> i dont care what you do to me , just dont a start kissing each other . </s> i dont like homo parades . </s>

the hotter it got , the better he felt . </s> scar didnt want to die , but it felt so damn good , he might just not want to stop . </s> then a shadow walked up out of the crowd . </s> scar , would you like a coffee ? </s> it was some zombie dick in a silver suit . </s>	coffee ? </s> free coffee . </s> hell , yeah . </s> somebody reached out of nowhere and cut his ropes , but scar didnt pay no attention to them . </s> he was trying to figure out this blood sucking son of a bitch . </s>

he was going to stand outside the door cause he had an idea . </s> he was at the counter when he remembered his idea again . </s> dammit . </s> he walked back out and waited until some lady pushed and he pushed against her . </s> she looked confused , then saw him and laughed and stopped pushing and so did he . </s>	she reached out and grabbed and pulled and so did he and she laughed again . </s> then she pushed and he pushed and she didnt laugh that time . </s> he kept going on it and finally she got mad and yelled at him , and then he laughed . </s> she went away and he walked in and he saw her sneak out behind him , but he didnt give a shit about her no more . </s> he belched loud and hard at the counter and ordered him a super-grand foamed up cappuccino with caramel or some female shit like that . </s>
them female coffees was actually pretty good if they wasnt too much milk in em . </s> he sat down and somebody handed him a big , hot black coffee just like he liked it and he remembered hed ordered himself a female coffee but he was glad to get this instead so he didnt say nothing . </s> he took off that damn thing they always put on there to keep idiots from burning their hands and threw it at the dude . </s> them things is stupid and theys for sissies . </s> he upended the sugar for a seven count , but he didnt stir it . </s>	he wanted to eat it with a spoon after he drank the coffee . </s> there werent no norwangey boondoggle there neither and he was gon na get mad about that but he knew it wouldnt matter cause hed forget fore he ever found that silver suit wearing asshole . </s> so he just drunk his coffee and stared people down till his watch buzzed and he read it . </s> my name is goat , he yelled . </s> i have a proposition for you suckbunnies . </s>
some dude what worked there came and asked him to sit down and scar said hed be a bit quieter but he needed to talk to somebody about nuclear physics . </s> he said some shit hed probably read in a book the other day and some dude started talking on him . </s> scar gave him one of them little cards after the watch buzzed and told him to . </s> the geeky little pencil dick read it and laughed and said he was in , whatever that meant . </s> the watch buzzed again . </s>	dont tell nobody neither , scar said after he read the words . </s> troll llort started as a flame-collector . </s> he railed on christian websites , hit-n-run posting , baiting , sockpuppets . </s> he had multiple web personas that fought at each other , yelling most of the time . </s> he cutn-pasted long gay porn narratives on right wing pages . </s>

searchlores.org/trolls troll v. , n . </s> to utter a posting on usenet designed to attract predictable responses or flames . </s> derives from the phrase `` trolling for newbies '' ; which in turn comes from mainstream `` trolling '' , a style of fishing in which one trails bait through a likely spot hoping for a bite . </s> the well-constructed troll is a post that induces lots of newbies and flamers to make themselves look even more clueless than they already do , while subtly conveying to the more savvy and experienced that it is in fact a deliberate troll . </s> if you do n't fall for the joke , you get to be in on it . </s>	you choose seven groups . </s> you then write an eight paragraph troll with a paragraph for each group and a spare one for yourself with which to lob in a gratuitous insult to everyone who was dumb enough to read your troll . </s> drag them off-topic - the further off-topic the better . </s> remember , you are trying to waste their time . </s> never take sides - remember that your goal is not to win an argument , rather it is to provoke a futile one that runs forever . </s>
you want to try to ensure that you have the broadest possible range of opinions as this is the easiest way to sow confusion . </s> the more confusion the less the likelihood of your troll being exposed for what it is . </s> it can also be shown that the inclusion of just one totally off-topic newsgroup can have dramatic effects . </s> these jerks fail to understand that trolls are the best way to drive people off the internet thus making available multi-mbs for the rest of us to download our porn . </s> a genuine troll which also included an artificial intelligence group , the result of which was to draw computer guru professor marvin minsky into a flamewar concerning ronald mcdonald 's exploitation of the disabled - an all-time classic piece of trolling - was written by a practicing veggie . </s>	mud wrestling on the internet : he wanted in . </s> he reversed the word , liked it , and then he was llort , the troll . </s> he studied , surfing to learn . </s> and nobody could see him , which he very much liked . </s> a good troll wrote their own rules . </s>
beginners liked to piss off new people . </s> an average troll wanted to get two people hating each other without being spotted himself so he could do it again . </s> a superior troll preferred to crash groups , turning their forum into a useless mess full of flames and off-topic rambles and rants . </s> for victory , the actuals abandoned at a seventy-five percent or greater rate . </s> then the troll , or trolls , won . </s>	with the finesse of a brain surgeon , the expert troll pitted groups against other groups , causing them to crash each other . </s> the levels of engagement were playtime , tactical , strategic and domination . </s> but there was a level beyond that , the mythical troll master , who steals a group , slowly and insidiously changing it to his own design , typically a much more trivial topic . </s> one master troll managed to convert a mercenary usenet group into a womens undergarment fetish group . </s> he learned troll history and theory . </s>
trolling began with the meow wars , when usenet was flooded with nonsense messages before most people even heard of the internet . </s> the perpetrator , named chuck truesdell , received the dubious honor of inventing spam . </s> llort especially loved godwins law , and used it to gauge his early victories . </s> the law stated that the larger a dialogue grows , the greater the likelihood of nazism being invoked to describe the opposition . </s> it was a generally held troll opinion that the first party to use the term nazi or hitler lost . </s>	for years , great flame wars were the mark of the artisan . </s> the goal was to divide a group against itself as much as possible , deemed fracture maxing . </s> it was best if the groups pulled themselves away based on subtle clues planted . </s> no one was exempt . </s> troll culture had no sacred icons or politics . </s>
a liberal group bent on exposing corporate malfeasance was as much a target as the powder puff fan-blog . </s> little girl fan-blogs were notoriously hard to beat , though . </s> young girls had a tenacious ability to get back to topics of inordinate mundanity combined with a single minded adoration for innocuous drawings or plastic figurines of fictional girls . </s> he studied , practiced , and watched other trolls , then started his high game . </s> he decided monday was usenet trolling day , wednesday was blogtrolling day , and friday was kooking day . </s>	llort started as a loner , but quickly moved to group work to learn tactics . </s> he loved the military terminology . </s> he joined during a few minor projects and people liked his work . </s> he kept his cover good , which put him in a certain category , more to the front lines . </s> wave trolling was the principal methodology . </s>
he found himself in the relatively prestigious recon wave . </s> first wave , which came after , was the real cherry . </s> those guys were the best . </s> it took about twenty trollers to collapse a thousand person usenet group into a shambles . </s> recon were the spies . </s>	they joined a few weeks or months before and made friends but didnt disrupt . </s> wave one started the flame war , but did not appear to be trolls . </s> they crashed scientology against alternatehistory.usenet . </s> the attack folded in mormon religion , a harry potter group , and an suv fanlist . </s> it was a big attack with over a hundred trolls and the recon wave had two sub-waves . </s>
the total pacifist wave and the opening of topics wave . </s> if the topic openers got accused of trolling , the pacifists stepped in and defended them . </s> they didnt want flames at this point , just expanded topicality . </s> llort pasted a fictitious comment supposedly from the potter site onto suv.usenet about suvs never being able to run on magic . </s> a lot of old-timers cross-posted from both sites and the topic was officially pronounced useable back at troll headquarters . </s>	the potter actuals began harassing , almost , the suv site in a quest to determine what sort of suv potter would drive . </s> they wanted stats on owl-proofing , cauldron carrying , and potion resistant seat material . </s> harry potter emerged as the best ticket in , as anything could be compared to magic , then cross-posted . </s> the potter recon troll compared dianetics to sirius black , fucked-up , but sympathetic . </s> the hubbards got a bit flamey , but the first recons calmed them . </s>
that was great , because now flames were in play , and a lot of the first recons had airtight covers as peace-keepers . </s> of course , cross-posting that harry was a mere alternate history of the lion , the witch and the wardrobe , garnered some book length essays on why harry had no relation to the world of narnia . </s> the narnia usenet folded itself in by a cross-posting from a non-troll who was , beautifully , accused of trolling . </s> llort and other real trolls lobbied for his expulsion . </s> also , the puzzling question : what level scientologist would malfoy be ? </s>	he wouldnt , according to one response , scientology was good and malfoy was evil . </s> two loose cannons on the recon team waited for replies from actuals ( non-trolls ) and jumped in with rambling diatribes about how interesting it was . </s> they wandered enough to stretch the topic , but kept it below the wing-nut threshold . </s> they peppered their unsavory essays with punctuation smileys , just kidding , and links to near-topic websites . </s> later , to draw attention away from the real troll goal , these recons elevated the strangeness of their posts . </s>
they called it kooking , a favorite troll past-time . </s> kooking , or grossly off-topic rambling , never made troll headlines , but it was a way to sharpen the tools and it was dead fun , so everyone did it on occasion . </s> after wave one hit , there was a serious debate among the trolls about folding in the creation vs evolution usenet group , which was massive . </s> it was too easy , most trolls said . </s> the site was already so hot that it was enjoyable just to read the constant flame-war and the over-all vote was against it . </s>	a rogue troll did it , anyway , asking the feasibly interesting question : is hermione an evolutionist or a creationist ? </s> go to alt.usenet.creationvsevolution and ask . </s> a lot of potter actuals decided it was worth the trip . </s> then they had a six-way , including five of the largest usenet groups in existence . </s> they had to recruit more trolls , but that was easy . </s>
keeping it under wraps was tough , but trolls had some ethics , so the cover held . </s> the real method was to never express opinions , but have the actuals do it based on the almost insipid vagueness of the trolling notions . </s> the topics stretched as all those muggles fell to the power of the trolls weirding ways . </s> wave one had a master player . </s> he hit llort with a low-level flame , saying that in any history , alternate or not , sorcerers could not possibly be descended from monkeys . </s>	if so , how could they drive suvs ? </s> one of the loose cannons escalated to full kooking based on the post . </s> he got banned , but llort lobbied for his return based on freedom of speech . </s> he kooked again and was mostly ignored from then on . </s> they eventually crashed three of the groups . </s>
cross-topicality was llorts specialty and ultimate masterpiece . </s> after the potter suv wars , he moved to solo pastures , and herded , in a ring , fourteen groups from ultra-conservative to ultra-liberal and continuing back to the first group . </s> a white supremacist usenet group was led , in twos and threes to a right wing southern baptist usenet which he migrated to a return the confederacy group . </s> the next was tricky . </s> the confederates raided a southern gentlemans sporting group which dealt largely with horses . </s>	he slid them into a polo group , where he almost lost the whole project to a flame war : the damn polo yankees against the well-heeled rednecks . </s> the preppies rolled nicely to an equestrian site . </s> he found a farmers blog and the equestrians took it over . </s> an organic animal farming spot drew off the lost souls of farmer dean and the organics happily jumped to an animal rights activist group which grumbled their way to a native americans kill animals with dignity group , alt.usenet.indianbuffalo . </s> they invaded a group devoted to coin collecting called buffalo nickel . </s>
getting users to cross the technically intimidating blog to usenet line was tough , but he encouraged people to try this cool new group , where people really knew their stuff . </s> he parlayed the coin collectors into a collectors in general group and they bumped to a gun collectors spot which grumbled but took a new home from some hunters who commandeered an nra subsite where a natural step led back to the original white supremacy group . </s> a water-wheel , he called it . </s> it was a proud piece of work , and the circle kept slowly turning with little effort once he closed the loop . </s> another troll named it the superconductor effect . </s>	at the end of each week , he posted you have all been trolled . </s> you are idiots . </s> the replies read ignore him , hes a troll , and , please dont feed the troll . </s> others soon topped his design with the figure eight which used one group for two migration points . </s> the new trolling was to keep groups functioning and keep people migrating . </s>
shepherd trolling , rather than destruction trolling . </s> after that , trolling lost interest . </s> llort wanted to live his life and pursue his career so he found a massive online urban fantasy game called boston commons where he enrolled at harvard university . </s> something else happened that looked cool . </s> he got a business card from a smelly homeless guy wearing an eye patch . </s>	he said his name was scar jones , or goat , he wasnt very clear . </s> but the card was . </s> he checked out the website . </s> it was an invitation to set up a blog and be part of a crazy super-anonymous puzzle-game . </s> it looked easy and fun , so he signed up as goat.troll . </s>
blog live entropy controlled the internet , as much as anyone could . </s> he did so with a four hundred million node botnet , spread throughout home and business computers all over the globe . </s> he got a card from scar personally , and was building a plan , based on the goat blog stunt . </s> it would make headline news in every part of the world . </s> he tasked the botnet to search for goat himself . </s>	it hit dead-ends . </s> he couldnt find the originator in one hour and he wanted to give goat a medal for it . </s> entropy was very hard to hide from . </s> he dropped the search , then decided he wanted to not know . </s> while he was waiting for opening day , entropy griefed . </s>
he did many other things , of course , this was just a single function in the outspread of entropy , a means of relaxing . </s> he was a talent-stalker , as well . </s> when he saw llorts antics with the water-wheel , he programmed an agent to watch his activity . </s> thats where griefing came in . </s> llort liked mmorgs , so entropy wrote one , designed to his specs , and invited him for a free lifetime membership , in honor of the water wheel . </s>	the fool probably thought he was a fellow troll . </s> boston commons was an urban fantasy game centered around harvard , with witches , elves , and werewolves . </s> llort wanted to be a troll in the game and entropy liked his approach . </s> no trolls , his expert system administrator , the dean , e-mailed . </s> llort trolled a player , and convinced them to petition for the introduction of trolls . </s>
how about orcs , instead ? </s> the dean responded . </s> theyre pretty much the same . </s> after a response detailing the numerous differences between the two , llort entered the game as an orc . </s> the game moved faster than real-time : one week per year . </s>	in ten weeks , llort had a doctoral degree , at great effort , from harvard and the dean offered him a job . </s> three weeks and some character challenges later , he was on the tenure track teaching genetics of non-humans , and spent time in the lab trying to reverse orcism . </s> he claimed orcs came originally from trolls and could be trolls again . </s> entropy knew he was invested heavily . </s> llort spent an average of eight hours a day in-game . </s>
entropy had a bowl of wheaties and meandered the internet aimlessly . </s> he had tried to make hittup slash the new insider term for the internet , but it didnt catch . </s> he loved owning the lingo and it irritated him to fail . </s> such things were a test of his real influence . </s> he griefed llort again . </s>	he had plans long-term for him , but wanted to probe for weaknesses . </s> he hoped his orc professor would commit suicide . </s> an orc professor , stupid . </s> the guy was talented , but he needed to grow up . </s> llort the troll was soon to become entropys minion . </s>
